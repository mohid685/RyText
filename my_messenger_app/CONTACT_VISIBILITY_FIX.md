# Contact Visibility Fix

## Issue Fixed
- **Syntax Errors**: Fixed unclosed brackets, duplicate method definitions, and misplaced code around line 1594
- **Contact Visibility Logic**: Modified the contact system so that only manually added contacts appear in each user's chat list

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Syntax Errors
- Removed extra closing brace `});` that was causing parsing errors
- Fixed bracket matching issues in the contact addition logic

### 2. Updated Contact Visibility Logic

#### Before (Bidirectional):
- When userA adds userB → Both users appear in each other's chat lists immediately
- This was achieved by automatically adding userA to userB's contacts when userB was added

#### After (Manual Only):
- When userA adds userB → Only userB appears in userA's chat list
- userA will only appear in userB's chat list if userB also manually adds userA
- Removed automatic bidirectional contact creation

### 3. Modified `_listenToChats()` Method
- **Old Logic**: Listened to all shared chats where user is a participant
- **New Logic**: Listens to user's own contacts collection and shows only those contacts
- Only shows contacts that have `registered: true` and a valid `chatId`

### 4. Updated Contact Addition Logic
- Removed automatic addition of current user to other user's contacts
- Each user must manually add contacts to see them in their chat list
- Chat creation still works bidirectionally (shared chat for messaging)

## Technical Details

### Modified Functions:
1. `_listenToChats()` - Now filters based on user's contact list
2. `_fetchChatParticipant()` - New helper function to get chat participant info
3. Contact addition logic in FloatingActionButton onPressed

### Data Structure:
- Chat visibility is now based on individual user's contacts collection
- Shared chats still exist for messaging between users
- Only users who have mutually added each other will see each other in their lists

## Testing Requirements
1. UserA adds UserB → Only UserB appears in UserA's list
2. UserB adds UserA → Now UserA appears in UserB's list
3. Messaging works correctly between users who have added each other
4. RyAI integration continues to work as expected

## Benefits
- More privacy-focused contact system
- Users have control over who appears in their chat list
- Follows conventional messaging app behavior (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.)
- Maintains shared chat functionality for actual messaging
